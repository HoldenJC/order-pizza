## Description

A website created with JS and HTML that allows the user to fill out a fictional pizza order form where they can choose pizza size and toppings, then have a price returned to them on form submission.

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **User can choose pizza size from dropdown and user choice will be saved into object on form submission** | (user selects medium) | pizza.size = medium |
| **User can choose zero or more toppings to add to their pizza from list which will be saved into object on form submission** | (user selects pepperoni and olives) | pizza.toppings = ["pepperoni", "olives"] |
| **Pizza price is calculated after form submission based on user choices (larger the pizza / number of toppings = more expensive)** | (user submits medium pizza with 2 toppings) | (some calculation) $15.00 |
| **User can add more pizza's to their order using the same pizza form** | (user fills out pizza form and submits several times) | (several pizzas are stored in overall order) |
